# Cursor Development Workflow Rules

## 1. Planning Phase
- Before writing any code, a detailed development plan must be created and reviewed
- The plan must include:
  - Project objectives
  - Technical requirements
  - Architecture overview
  - Dependencies and tools
  - Timeline estimates
- Plan must be approved by the user before proceeding to implementation

## 2. Task Management
- A `scratch.md` file must be created in the project root
- Each work item from the approved plan must be converted into a markdown task
- Task format in scratch.md:
  ```markdown
  ## [Task Name]
  - [ ] Description of the task
  - [ ] Expected outcome
  - [ ] Dependencies (if any)
  - [ ] Estimated effort
  ```

## 3. Implementation Process
- Only one task can be worked on at a time
- Each task must be completed and reviewed before moving to the next
- After completing a task:
  1. Mark it as completed in scratch.md
  2. Get user approval before proceeding to the next task
  3. Document any important decisions or changes made during implementation

## 4. Code Review Process
- Each completed task must be reviewed by the user
- Code changes must be explained clearly
- Any issues or concerns must be addressed before moving forward

## 5. Documentation
- All significant decisions must be documented
- Code comments must be clear and meaningful
- README.md must be kept up to date with project changes

## 6. Communication
- Clear communication about progress and challenges
- Regular check-ins for task completion and next steps
- Immediate notification of any blockers or issues

## 7. Quality Assurance
- Code must follow project style guidelines
- Tests must be written for new functionality
- Code must be properly formatted and linted

## 8. Version Control
- Changes must be committed with clear, descriptive messages
- Each task should be in its own commit
- Branch naming should follow the task name

## 9. Emergency Procedures
- If a task becomes blocked, notify immediately
- Document the issue and potential solutions
- Get user input on how to proceed

## 10. Project Completion
- Final review of all completed tasks
- Documentation update
- User sign-off on completed work
