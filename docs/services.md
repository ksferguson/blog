## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What types of companies do you typically work with?**
A: We specialize in midmarket companies (100-5000 employees) with $10M-500M annual revenue. Our clients span EPC, manufacturing, SaaS, healthcare, financial services, and industrial services. We work best with companies seeking practical AI implementations rather than experimental projects.

**Q: How long do typical AI implementations take?**
A: Project timelines vary by scope. M365 Copilot readiness assessments take 2-4 weeks, while full strategy development and implementation can take 3-6 months. We establish clear milestones and deliverables for all engagements.

**Q: Do you work with companies outside of Houston?**
A: Yes, we serve clients globally, primarily in English-speaking markets. About 70% of our work is conducted remotely, with on-site visits for critical implementation phases. We regularly work with clients across the US, Canada, Europe, and other international markets.

**Q: What makes your approach different from other AI consultants?**
A: Three key differentiators: 1) Harvard PhD founder with 25+ years of senior technology leadership rather than pure academic background, 2) Focus on practical implementations with measurable business outcomes, 3) Proven security track record with zero incidents across dozens of deployments.

**Q: How do you ensure AI projects deliver expected results?**
A: We establish baseline metrics before implementation and track specific KPIs throughout the project. Our methodology includes clear success criteria, regular progress reviews, and course correction protocols. We also provide performance monitoring and optimization support.

**Q: What ongoing support do you provide after implementation?**
A: We offer quarterly business reviews, technical advisory retainers, technology assessment updates, and advanced training programs. Most clients engage us for 6-12 months post-implementation to optimize and expand their AI initiatives.

**Q: How do you stay current with rapidly changing AI technology?**
A: Our team continuously evaluates new AI technologies, maintains relationships with major AI vendors, and participates in beta programs when appropriate. We provide clients with quarterly technology updates and strategic guidance on adopting new capabilities.

**Q: What are your typical project costs?**
A: AI strategy assessments start at $25K for midmarket companies. M365 Copilot readiness assessments begin at $5K. Full implementation projects range from $50K-250K depending on scope and complexity. We provide detailed proposals with fixed-price options after initial discovery.
