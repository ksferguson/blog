# AI-Powered Slide Decks: In under an Hour

## üß† The Pitch Meeting Is in 3 Days...

You're staring at a blank slide, your designer is out, and your calendar is packed with back-to-back meetings. Sound familiar?

What if you could generate a professional, visual, on-brand presentation in under an hour ‚Äî without touching PowerPoint formatting tools or scrambling for stock images?


<!-- more -->

Welcome to the executive workflow for AI-powered presentations.

## üí° From Idea to Investor-Ready Deck ‚Äî In Under an Hour

Here's the streamlined process high-performing execs and consultants are using today:

### **1. Generate Your Content Framework (10 minutes)**  
**Tool: ChatGPT or Claude Project**  
Prompt your assistant with something like:  
> ‚ÄúCreate a 10-slide deck on our AI strategy, covering use cases, implementation roadmap, and ROI for our manufacturing business.‚Äù

Include your blogs, strategy docs, or previous presentations in your Project for a tailored draft.

### **2. Turn It Into Slides (15 minutes)**  
**Tool: [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app)**  
Paste your outline into Gamma and see a striking presentation build itself in seconds:  
- Clean layouts  
- AI-generated visuals  
- Cohesive styling

### **3. Refine and Personalize (20 minutes)**  
- Edit picture prompts and models to regenerate pics
Use prompts like:  
- ‚ÄúMake this slide more minimalist‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúAdd an icon for human-AI collaboration‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúTurn this into a comparison slide‚Äù

### **4. Export to PowerPoint (5 minutes)**  
Always export for flexibility ‚Äî offline presenting, editing, and reviewing with stakeholders.

## üî• Why This Workflow Wins

- **Faster slide creation**
- **More focus on message and storytelling**
- **Immediate stakeholder alignment**

Instead of sweating the format, you're elevating the strategic narrative.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Generic Slides:** Use your own language and context to personalize prompts.
- **Off-brand visuals:** Upload or define brand assets inside both your Project and your Gamma theme. [Import Your Brand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6kd2HS7VxA)
- **Too automated:** Always inject personal insight into key points.

## ‚úÖ Action: Try It Today

1. Open ChatGPT or Claude and say:  
   > ‚ÄúMake a 6-slide deck on how generative AI will reshape our client experience strategy.‚Äù

2. Drop it into [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app)

3. Tweak, export, review, and impress.

- Website only, good for cloud-centric people

- Interesting looks with multiple, varied slides within a theme (too many?)
- Doesn't export perfectly to Powerpoint - you will have to resize text boxes, some features will be lost
- You are on the hook for an Annual subscription ~$144 after a short trial, cancel immediately after testing if you try it

### Plus AI (add-in for PPT)

AI PowerPoint Rating: :star: :star: :star:

- Add-in for PowerPoint (or Google Slides), so no fidelity issues
- Test prompt was too long
- Basic plan is $15 month, but that only gets you 5K context
- More context requires Pro at $25/month
- Gamma slides were better at half the cost

Aside: plusai.com has a good overview of many of these tools: https://plusai.com/blog/best-ai-presentation-makers

### Microsoft Copilot (M365 Personal)

AI PowerPoint Rating: :star: :star:

- Doesn't allow file attachments (Mar 2025)
- Could not use my deck outline due to small context window
- Can generate slides one at a time
- Limited AI Credits with M365 Personal 
- Previously I've more successfully used Copilot Pro at \$20/month and/or M365 Copilot at ~$360/year

### Pitch

AI PowerPoint Rating: :star: :star:

- Great looking product, but more of a full presentation authoring package
- Available via web or app
- Could not use my deck outline due to small context window
- Good PowerPoint support

### SlidesGPT (in ChatGPT)

AI PowerPoint Rating: :star: :star:

- Inside ChatGPT (popular Custom GPT)
- Nice icons
- Images from Unsplash (not novel)
- Can only generate a few slides at a time, very disjoint experience
- Gave up without checking the PowerPoint quality

### ChatGPT

AI PowerPoint Rating: :star:

- Does great job (5/5) of writing slide content in text/Markdown 
- Use inside normal App/Project to generate slide content
- Asking for slides proper just dumps content into Python script
- Generated PowerPoint slides are useless 

### Claude

AI PowerPoint Rating: :star:

- Does great job (5/5) of writing slide content in text/Markdown 
- Use inside normal App/Project to generate slide content
- Doesn't generate PowerPoint

## Conclusion

Use ChatGPT or Claude to build the deck description in Markdown, then use that text in https://gamma.app to generate and edit the slides & images using AI. Export to PowerPoint for review.
